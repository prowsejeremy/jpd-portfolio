# Jeremy Prowse Digital
## Portfolio site

If, for whatever bizarre reason you find yourself reading this, welcome! This is code behind my personal portfolio site: [jpd.nz](https://jpd.nz). I have used this project to explore a few ideas I've wanted to play around with as well as a testing ground for a number of technologies I've been interested in trying out.

The site, while rather simple in design has a few key elements going on under the hood üëÄ:

- Next.js 15 using the src dir and app router
- Sass Modules
- Fully Typescript
- Scalable UI/Design > 1024px
- Deployment and hosting via AWS Amplify
- pnpm package manager
- A super secret easter egg ü§´ that integrates with [AWS AppSync to host a custom backend](https://medium.com/@prowsejeremy/aws-appsync-api-access-via-iam-user-in-nodejs-95f8d722e3c6)

### Setup and dev

- Ensure you have a current Node.js (20>=) development environment setup.
- Configure a local .env file with the appropriate environment variables then run:

```
  pnpm i && pnpm run dev
```

- Or alternatively if you have docker setup and [configured with caddy](https://gist.github.com/prowsejeremy/696764a4a6a9ca56181dacd5c934bb24):

```
  docker compose -f docker/compose.yml watch
```

Head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [jpd.test](https://jpd.test) in your browser and you're off to the races üêé
